# Dump box
---

Command and state tracking for the dump box strategy of getting things
done in an ad hoc manner.

Is this just another board? the dump board? with different semantics.
Where cards specify their own path through the columns. After
excersizing is done it goes back to the bottom of To do, but other
things are tasks that once they are done they go to Completed.

Could add some randomness to what is chosen to do at any given time
based on how long it's been etc.

Could label some "Frog". Could also reccomend some as the frog if the
system sees that you've been avoiding something

Could include contexts from GTD. Am I on my phone? at my computer? at
home? Is it the morning? Have I eaten the frog yet? How many things
have I done recently?

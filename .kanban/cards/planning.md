# Planning space, knowledge base

CLI and/or TUI planing space, knowledge base, wiki

Content in markdown files in git

Start with the assumption that planning documents eventually become
documentation (assuming we keep going on them long enough for them to
be documentation). They are sort of documentation of future features,
then when those features are built, they become docs for those
features.

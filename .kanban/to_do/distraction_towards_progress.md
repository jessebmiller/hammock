# Distraction towards progress
---

The computer is an infinate chasm of distractions. Find a way to use
the techniques to get some controll over what I'm distracted by. Like
I'd rather be distracted by a project I'm excited about than a youtube
rabbit hole (unless I need the break in which case I can seek out
whatever I want)

Make my computer put things in front of me that I want to
remember. Make it help me become the person I want to be.

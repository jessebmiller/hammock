# Do we want branching kanban boards
---

Putting the board in git means it can branch.

* Problem arises when I take a note for something not in this branch
  then abandon the branch. How do I make sure that note gets back to
  the main branch?

* Git hooks? automatically commit and merge kanban files aggressively?
